# GranolaBars_SearchEngine

Workflow style:
    We have utilized a customized version of the feature branching workflow, but instead of a branch per feature, we are using a branch for each member.
    When a member finishes the feature that they finish, they would generally push to their own branch and create a pull request.
    At that point another member would review the pull request, and if approved, the branch will be merged to master.
